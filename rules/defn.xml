              within a specification, and these targets may be diverse so as to
              reflect different aspects of a specification. For example, a

	<definition term="release">
		<p>A reference schema document set published by the NIEM Program Management Office (PMO) at <link>http://release.niem.gov/</link> and assigned a unique version number.  Each schema document in the set defines data components for use in NIEM information exchanges.  Each release is independent of other releases, although a schema document may occur in multiple releases.  A release is of high quality, and has been vetted by NIEM governance bodies.  A numbered release may be a major, minor, or micro release.</p>
	</definition>
	<definition term="major release">
		<p>A NIEM release in which the NIEM Core reference schema document has changed since previous releases.  The first integer of the version number indicates the major release series; for example, versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 are different major releases.</p>
	</definition>
	<definition term="minor release">
		<p>A NIEM release in which the NIEM Core has not changed from previous releases in the series, but at least one or more domain reference schema documents have changed.  A second digit greater than zero in the version number indicates a minor release (for example, v2.1).  Note also that major v2.0 and minor v2.1 are in the same series (i.e., series 2) and contain the same NIEM Core schema document.</p>
	</definition>
	<definition term="micro release">
		<p>A NIEM release in which neither the NIEM Core nor the domain reference schema documents have changed from the previous major or minor release, but one or more new reference schema documents have been added (without impact to domain or Core schemas).  A third digit greater than zero in the version number indicates a micro release (for example, v2.1.1  note that this release does not exist as of this date).</p>
	</definition>
	<definition term="domain update">
		<p>An MPD that contains a reference schema document or document set issued by one or more domains that constitutes new content or an update to content that was previously published in a NIEM release.

</definition>
	<definition term="core update">
	<p>An MPD that applies changes to a given NIEM core schema document or document set.  A core update never replaces a NIEM core; instead, it is used to add new schema documents, new data components, new code values, etc. to a particular NIEM core.  In some cases, a core update can make minor modifications to existing core data components.</p>
</definition>
	<definition term="Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD)">

	</definition>
	<definition term="Information Sharing Enterprise">

The member organizations have similar business definitions for objects used in an information exchange and can usually agree on their common BIEC names and definitions.</p>
	</definition>
	<definition term="Business Information Exchange Component (BIEC)">
		<p>A NIEM-conformant XML schema data component definition or declaration (for a type, element, attribute, or other XML construct) reused, subsetted, extended, and/or created from NIEM that meets a particular recurring business requirement for an information sharing enterprise.</p>
	</definition>
	<definition term="Enterprise Information Exchange Model (EIEM)">
		<p>An MPD that contains a NIEM-conformant schema document set that defines and declares data components to be consistently reused in the IEPDs of an enterprise.  An EIEM is a collection of BIECs organized into a schema document subset and one or more extension schema documents.  Constraint schema documents and non-NIEM-conformant external standards schema documents with type adapters are optional.</p>
	</definition>
	<definition term="subset schema document">
		<p>An XML schema document that meets all of the following criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>It is built from a reference schema document set where one or more reference schema documents has been substituted by a its corresponding subset schema document.</p></li>
			<li><p>It is built from a reference schema document by applying subset operations to the XML schema statements in a reference schema document.</p></li>
			<li><p>It is explicitly designated as a subset schema document.  This is accomplished by declaration in the relevant MPD catalog or by a tool-specific mechanism outside the subset schema document.</p></li>
			<li><p>It has a target namespace previously defined by a reference schema document.  That is, it does not provide original definitions and declarations for schema components, but instead provides an alternate schema representation of components that are defined by a reference schema document.</p></li>
			<li><p>It does not alter the business semantics of components in its namespace.  The reference schema document defines these business semantics.</p></li>
			<li><p>It is intended to express the limited vocabulary necessary for an IEPD or EIEM and to support XML Schema validation for an IEPD.</p></li>

		<p>A NIEM-conformant schema document that adds domain or application specific content to the base NIEM model.</p>
	</definition>
	<definition term="external schema documents">
		<p>Any XML schema document that is not a NIEM-supporting schema and that is not NIEM-conformant.</p>
	</definition>	
	<definition term="constraint schema document">
		<p>A schema document that imposes additional constraints on NIEM-conformant instance XML documents.  A constraint schema document or document set validates additional constraints imposed on an instance XML document only after it is known to be NIEM-conformant (i.e., has been validated with a reference schema document set, or schema document subset, and applicable extension schema documents).  Constraint schema document validation is a second-pass validation process that occurs independently of and after conformance validation.  A constraint schema document need not validate constraints that are applied by other schema documents.  See also <termRef>constraint schema document set</termRef>.</p>
	</definition>
	<definition term="constraint schema document set">
